# Example Synonym Configuration for Tagex
#
# This file defines synonym relationships between tags. When tagex processes
# your vault, it will recognize these relationships and suggest merges.
#
# SETUP:
# 1. Copy this file to your vault root as .tagex-synonyms.yaml
# 2. Customize the synonyms for your vault's tag structure
# 3. Run: tagex analyze synonyms /path/to/vault
#
# FORMAT:
# Each entry maps a canonical tag to its synonyms:
#
#   canonical-tag:
#     - synonym1
#     - synonym2
#     - synonym3
#
# The canonical tag is the preferred form that will be recommended
# in merge suggestions.

# Notes:

# - Hierarchical tags (like 'work/meeting') are separate from flat tags
# - This file only defines explicit synonyms you've identified
# - The analyze commands will also find similar tags automatically
