# Example Configuration for Tagex
#
# This file configures how tagex processes tags in your vault.
#
# SETUP:
# 1. Copy this file to your vault root as .tagex-config.yaml
# 2. Customize the settings for your vault's needs
# 3. Settings will be automatically loaded by tagex commands
#
# All settings are optional and have sensible defaults.

# Plural/Singular Preference
# Controls how tagex chooses between plural and singular tag variants
plural:
  # Preference mode:
  #   - usage: Prefer the most-used form (default)
  #   - plural: Always prefer plural forms (books, ideas, projects)
  #   - singular: Always prefer singular forms (book, idea, project)
  preference: usage

  # Usage ratio threshold (only applies when preference: usage)
  # A form must be used at least this many times more than alternatives
  # to be preferred. Default: 2.0
  #
  # Examples:
  #   - 2.0: "books" (10 uses) beats "book" (4 uses) → 10/4 = 2.5 ratio ✓
  #   - 2.0: "books" (10 uses) vs "book" (6 uses) → 10/6 = 1.67 ratio ✗
  #          (ratio too small, falls back to preference mode)
  usage_ratio_threshold: 2.0
