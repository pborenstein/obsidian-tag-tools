### Executive Summary

Overall, the documentation is of very high quality. The diagrams describing the current state of the architecture and the analytics tools are exceptionally accurate. However, one document describes a planned feature that has not been implemented, making its diagrams an inaccurate representation of the current code.

### 1. `doc/ARCHITECTURE.md`

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the project's structure.

*   **Core Components Diagram**: This diagram is a faithful representation of the project's modular structure. It correctly identifies all the main directories (`extractor`, `parsers`, `operations`, `utils`, `tag-analysis`) and the key classes and responsibilities within them, such as `TagExtractor`, `TagOperationEngine`, and the individual parsers.
*   **Data Flow Pipeline Diagram**: The step-by-step data flow from file discovery to output formatting is depicted perfectly. My analysis of `extractor/core.py` and `main.py` confirms that the code follows this exact pipeline.
*   **Module Responsibilities & Operations Diagrams**: These diagrams accurately detail the CLI commands implemented in `main.py` using `click`, the specific classes within each module, and the logical flow of the tag modification operations (rename, merge, delete), including the `dry-run` mechanism.
*   **Tag Validation System Diagram**: The validation rules listed in the diagram (e.g., no pure numbers, filter technical noise) are precisely implemented in the `is_valid_tag` function within `utils/tag_normalizer.py`.

**Verdict: Highly Accurate.** The diagrams in this document are an excellent and reliable guide to the codebase.

### 2. `doc/ANALYTICS.md`

This document details the tag analysis scripts.

*   **Pair Analyzer Algorithm Flow**: The diagram accurately illustrates the process used in `tag-analysis/pair_analyzer.py`. The code contains the corresponding functions for each step: `build_file_to_tags_map`, `calculate_pairs`, and `find_tag_clusters`.
*   **Merge Analyzer Embedding Algorithm**: This diagram is also highly accurate. The `tag-analysis/merge_analyzer.py` script uses `scikit-learn` to build a TF-IDF matrix and calculate cosine similarity, just as depicted. The `pyproject.toml` file confirms `scikit-learn` is a project dependency. Furthermore, the documented fallback strategy for when `scikit-learn` is unavailable is also present in the code.

**Verdict: Highly Accurate.** These diagrams correctly describe the functionality and algorithms within the analysis tools.

### 3. `doc/TAG_TYPE_FILTERING_PLAN.md`

This document outlines a plan to add new filtering capabilities. Accuracy here is a measure of whether the plan was implemented.

*   **CLI Options**: The plan specifies new CLI options, `--frontmatter-only` and `--inline-only`. These options **do not exist** in the current version of `main.py`.
*   **Code Modifications**:
    *   A `tag_types` parameter was added to the `TagExtractor` class in `extractor/core.py` as planned.
    *   However, the crucial logic that would use this parameter to conditionally process only frontmatter or inline tags **has not been implemented**. The code still extracts both types of tags regardless of this parameter's value.
    *   The plan to update the `TagOperationEngine` in `operations/tag_operations.py` was also **not implemented**.

**Verdict: Inaccurate.** This document describes an unimplemented feature. It is a "plan," and it appears the plan was started but never completed. The diagrams and descriptions do not reflect the current functionality of the code.
